## Opening a PR
Before we can accept a pull request from you, you'll need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). It is an automated process and you will only need to sign the agreement once.

- In order to quickly review and accept your pull requests: create one pull request per issue and link the issue in the pull request.
- Never merge multiple requests in one unless they have the same root cause.
- Avoid pure formatting changes to code that have not been modified otherwise.
- Pull requests should contain tests whenever possible.
