# Contributing to containers-rest-cosmos-appservice-java

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

In order to quickly review and accept your pull requests

- Avoid pure formatting changes to code that have not been modified otherwise
- Pull requests should contain tests whenever possible
